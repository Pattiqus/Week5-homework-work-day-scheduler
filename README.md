<h1>Work Day Scheduler!</h1>
<body>
This repository contains the source code for a work day scheduler which is dynamically enabled with Javascript while utilizing jQuery.

The calander works by clicking on the input rows and typing in data points. Through the use of local storage, one the user hits the save button , these text inputs are saved to the browser to even if the page is refreshed, they remain there for use as a reminder.

Using moment.js & Javascript the page dynamically changes the colours of the input rows based upon the time. This highlights past , current and future tasks witha  grey, red & green hue respectivally.
